### More Information

 I am a Full Stack Web Developer passionate about revolutionizing the web UI to build the future. My software development experience with Pega, Javascript, SQL and DB2 has allowed me to deliver high-quality code throughout time. After moving to the Bay Area, the Full Stack and React nano degree at Udacity have helped me gain the best web development skills including Python, Java, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, various APIS such as REST, Google Maps, and frameworks such as Flask, React, Knockout, Bootstrap etc. I am currently open to remote/full-time/contract web developer positions across the Bay Area and don't need sponsorship for employment.
